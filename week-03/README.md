# Week 03: Python Basics Continued and Introduction to Geospatial Concepts
## Getting Started
During class, navigate to the following [link](https://lmu-climate-hub.briannapagan.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbriannapagan%2Flmu-climate-risk-spring-2025&branch=main&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Flmu-climate-risk-spring-2025%2Fweek-03) to access notebooks where we will be learning some core concepts.

We will be going over the following sections from Chapter 02: Basic Programing Concepts https://pythongis.org/part1/chapter-02/index.html as well as from Chapter 05-06: Getting started with GIS Python and vector data processing https://pythongis.org/part2/chapter-06/index.html


You will be expected to follow along and 'live script' the examples in your own notebook.
